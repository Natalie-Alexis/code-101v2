        <h2>Brooklyn Seafood, Steak & Oyster House</h2>
        <p>This classic Seattle steakhouse is a grand destination for diners looking to impress important clients. The saloon-meets-supper club decor features a copper counter with swivel stools and elegant tables dressed in white linens. While cooked-to order steaks, ribs and chops are well prepared, fish and seafood really earn Brooklyn its many years of high praise. Dinner reservations are suggested; this spot has a large following, and it can't hurt to call ahead just in case. Head to Brooklyn to impress business clients, a significant other, out-of-town visitors or simply to treat yourself to a special outing.</p>
